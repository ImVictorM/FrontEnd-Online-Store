# FrontEnd Online Store 🛒

## Project Context 💡

This project is a simplified version of an online store, without database persistence, developing its functionalities in a group according to demands defined in a Kanban board in a scenario close to the job market.

The application can:

- Search for products by terms and categories from the MercadoLibre API;
- Interact with the products sought to add and remove them from a shopping cart in different quantities;
- View details and previous reviews of a product, as well as create new reviews;
- Simulate checkout for selected items.
